What is an immigration regularization?
Regularization is the process by which the government of a country grants, for extraordinary reasons, residence to all those foreign citizens who are in an irregular situation (without papers).

And this is something that during the last months the almost 0.5 million foreign inhabitants in Spain who find themselves in this situation have requested, especially with the entry of the Socialist Party to the Spanish government.

There are also several political parties in Congress that defend this initiative, aiming to make it a reality.

Thus, this regularization would not be something new for the country. In 2005, the President of the Government, José Luís Rodriguez Zapatero, approved a massive regularization, granting residence to some 600,000 foreigners; obtaining quite positive effects for the country.

That is why many consider that this can be a totally correct measure during the current times, and the idea has even created movements like the “RegularizaciónYa” with increasing popularity.

In fact, certain proposals have been made to begin the process as soon as possible, but they are still inconclusive.

So, will we have a regularization of foreigners within the Spanish territory?

For many years, the idea of a possible mass regularization of foreigners in Spain (now under an irregular situation) has become more and more popular. Firstly, due to the many news items in favor of this idea. And secondly, because of the need created by the global pandemic for a reconstruction of the economy based on reindustrialization. This means that granting papers to many non-EU irregular citizens could become soon true.
